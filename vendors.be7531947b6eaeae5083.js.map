The `scopeName` will be added to\n * the class attribute of all rendered DOM. In addition, any style elements will\n * be automatically re-written with this `scopeName` selector and moved out\n * of the rendered DOM and into the document `<head>`.\n *\n * It is common to use this render method in conjunction with a custom element\n * which renders a shadowRoot. When this is done, typically the element's\n * `localName` should be used as the `scopeName`.\n *\n * In addition to DOM scoping, ShadyCSS also supports a basic shim for css\n * custom properties (needed only on older browsers like IE11) and a shim for\n * a deprecated feature called `@apply` that supports applying a set of css\n * custom properties to a given location.\n *\n * Usage considerations:\n *\n * * Part values in `<style>` elements are only applied the first time a given\n * `scopeName` renders. Subsequent changes to parts in style elements will have\n * no effect. Because of this, parts in style elements should only be used for\n * values that will never change, for example parts that set scope-wide theme\n * values or parts which render shared style elements.\n *\n * * Note, due to a limitation of the ShadyDOM polyfill, rendering in a\n * custom element's `constructor` is not supported. Instead rendering should\n * either done asynchronously, for example at microtask timing (for example\n * `Promise.resolve()`), or be deferred until the first time the element's\n * `connectedCallback` runs.\n *\n * Usage considerations when using shimmed custom properties or `@apply`:\n *\n * * Whenever any dynamic changes are made which affect\n * css custom properties, `ShadyCSS.styleElement(element)` must be called\n * to update the element. There are two cases when this is needed:\n * (1) the element is connected to a new parent, (2) a class is added to the\n * element that causes it to match different custom properties.\n * To address the first case when rendering a custom element, `styleElement`\n * should be called in the element's `connectedCallback`.\n *\n * * Shimmed custom properties may only be defined either for an entire\n * shadowRoot (for example, in a `:host` rule) or via a rule that directly\n * matches an element with a shadowRoot. In other words, instead of flowing from\n * parent to child as do native css custom properties, shimmed custom properties\n * flow only from shadowRoots to nested shadowRoots.\n *\n * * When using `@apply` mixing css shorthand property names with\n * non-shorthand names (for example `border` and `border-width`) is not\n * supported.\n */\nexport const render =\n    (result: unknown,\n     container: Element|DocumentFragment|ShadowRoot,\n     options: ShadyRenderOptions) => {\n      if (!options || typeof options !== 'object' || !options.scopeName) {\n        throw new Error('The `scopeName` option is required.');\n      }\n      const scopeName = options.scopeName;\n      const hasRendered = parts.has(container);\n      const needsScoping = compatibleShadyCSSVersion &&\n          container.nodeType === 11 /* Node.DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE */ &&\n          !!(container as ShadowRoot).host;\n      // Handle first render to a scope specially...\n      const firstScopeRender = needsScoping && !shadyRenderSet.has(scopeName);\n      // On first scope render, render into a fragment; this cannot be a single\n      // fragment that is reused since nested renders can occur synchronously.\n      const renderContainer =\n          firstScopeRender ? document.createDocumentFragment() : container;\n      litRender(\n          result,\n          renderContainer,\n          {templateFactory: shadyTemplateFactory(scopeName), ...options} as\n              RenderOptions);\n      // When performing first scope render,\n      // (1) We've rendered into a fragment so that there's a chance to\n      // `prepareTemplateStyles` before sub-elements hit the DOM\n      // (which might cause them to render based on a common pattern of\n      // rendering in a custom element's `connectedCallback`);\n      // (2) Scope the template with ShadyCSS one time only for this scope.\n      // (3) Render the fragment into the container and make sure the\n      // container knows its `part` is the one we just rendered.
